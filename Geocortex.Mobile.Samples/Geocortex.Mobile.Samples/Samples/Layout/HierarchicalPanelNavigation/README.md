# Hierarchical Panel Navigation

### Description
This sample demonstrates hierarchical panel navigation.

### Tips
- Activating multiple components in a panel pushes them onto a _navigation stack_.
- After navigating, panels will be given a _back_ button (in the top-left corner) to return to the previous component.
- Activating a previous component (i.e. activating stack 1 from stack 3) will _unwind_ the navigation stack back to the previous component.
