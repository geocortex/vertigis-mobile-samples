# Logging

### Description
This sample demonstrates logging in a Geocortex Mobile app.

### Tips
- There are four levels of logging available, in increasing severity:
  - Debug
  - Info
  - Warning
  - Error
- Apps can set their logging level. An app with a set logging level will only capture messages at that level, or more severe.
  - For example, an app set at **Info** logging level will collect **Info**, **Warning** and **Error** messages, but not **Debug** level.
- Use the Debug Console to review logged messages.
