# Basemap Toggle

### Description
A basemap toggle component that can toggle the active basemap and its visibility.

### Tips
- There are two controls - a button to change the active basemap, and a switch that toggles the basemap's visibility.
- Basemap toggle is implemented with a component, operation, service and view.
- The code-behind BasemapToggleView.xaml.cs uses dependency injection to access the MapView.
