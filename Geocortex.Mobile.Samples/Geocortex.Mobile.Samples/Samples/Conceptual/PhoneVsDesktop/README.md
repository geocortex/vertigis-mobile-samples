# Phone vs. Desktop

### Description
This sample demonstrates how to use an app's json configuration to select a layout based on form factor.

### Tips
- If the app is loaded on a desktop, the _desktop.xml_ layout is loaded.
- If the app is loaded on a phone, the _phone.xml_ layout is loaded.
  - Load this app on a phone and notice the taskbar is horizontal and anchored to the bottom of the screen.
