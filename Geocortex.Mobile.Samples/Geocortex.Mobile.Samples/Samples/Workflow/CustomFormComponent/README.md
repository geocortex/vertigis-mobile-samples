# Custom Workflow Form Component

### Description
This sample demonstrates the creation of a custom VertiGIS Studio Workflow form component.

### Tips
- The form activity **must** be registered using an implementation of the IActivityHandlerFactory.
- The form activity **must** be _run_ in the client workflow before use in a display form.
