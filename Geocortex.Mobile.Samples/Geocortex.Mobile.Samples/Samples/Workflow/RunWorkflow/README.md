# Run Workflow

### Description
This sample demonstrates running a VertiGIS Studio Workflow in VertiGIS Studio Mobile.

### Tips
- Workflows can be run from a number of places - a button, a taskbar button, or as an IWTM item.
- Workflows with the taskbar as a target will create a new taskbar button/panel to run the workflow within, when a workflow starts.
