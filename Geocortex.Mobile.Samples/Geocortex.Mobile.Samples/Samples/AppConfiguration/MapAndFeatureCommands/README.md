# Map and Feature Commands

### Description
This sample demonstrates common feature and map commands that are available in VertiGIS Studio Mobile.

### Tips
- Try clicking a feature or selecting a search result. Many commands only take effect when a feature is selected/highlighted, etc.
- Feature commands are configured as "feature actions" in a feature details panel, and take the feature as input.
- Commands and Feature Actions are configured in an app's json configuration.
- A Feature Action may chain together commands to create more complicated behaviors.
