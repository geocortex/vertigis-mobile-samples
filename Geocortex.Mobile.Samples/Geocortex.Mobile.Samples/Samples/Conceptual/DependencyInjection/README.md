# Dependency Injection

### Description
This sample demonstrates the use of dependency injection in VertiGIS Studio Mobile.

### Tips
- In this sample, MapRepository and IDialogController objects are made accessible through dependency injection by including them in a component's constructor.
- Similarly, other VertiGIS Studio Mobile objects may be made available by their inclusion in a class' constructor (i.e. AllEvents or AllOperations)
